Hello,
1. "LibE101" folder contains library project. Do not delete it in case you will want to make some changes to the library.
2. Copy of"libE101.so" file (the actual library file) should also be placed into /usr/lib folder. You need sudo priviliges to to that.

3. "LibTest" folder contains testing program. You can use to check all the hardware. We recommend that you use command line and makefile provided. For details see "readme.txt" in "libtest" folder.

Good luck.
